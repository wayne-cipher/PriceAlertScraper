##Laptop Stand Price Tracker

#Project Overview

This project, named "Laptop Stand Price Tracker," is a Python script designed to monitor the price of a specific laptop stand product on Jumia (a popular e-commerce platform in Kenya) and send an email notification when the price drops below a certain threshold. The script uses web scraping to extract price data, handles basic error scenarios, and automates price checking at regular intervals. This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, automation, email notification systems, and basic Python programming.
